This html file is a map of the Philippines with some tourist spots markers. 
When you hover over the mouse on the location marker, the name of the tourist location and a short description will pop-up.

Edits: Additional tourist spots were added such as Hundred Islands, Baguio, Sagada, Baler, Siquijor, Batanes, San Juan, La Union. 
       Additional spots may be added but that would require more information so a dataset would be created for additional places.
